        review: 'Where do I beginâ€¦ this cabin in the woods is magical. It is easy to feel one with the surrounding gorgeous nature because of the unique mirrored walls. The hosts were super easy to communicate with and left us a bottle of Prosecco, as well as binoculars for watching wildlife (we saw some birds). Shampoo and conditioner were top notch, and the view from the jacuzzi is pretty unbeatable. It is a unique romantic place well worth the money.'

The lake and mountain view are beautiful and the house adds to all the charm with its fireplace, sauna, and beautiful rustic wood interior. The host was very attentive of us and provided us with a fridge full of water, yogurt, and juice. We felt very well looked after. You will not regret staying here!'
